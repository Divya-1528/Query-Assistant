For my project, I developed a chatbot that assists prospective students by providing detailed information about the college admission process. I created this chatbot using IBM Cloud resources, including Watsonx Assistant, Watson Machine Learning, Watson Studio, and IBM Cloud Object Storage.

Here's an overview of the steps and the setup:

Designing the Conversation Flow: Using Watsonx Assistant, I designed the conversational flow for the chatbot, structuring it to respond effectively to queries about the admission process, eligibility criteria, documents required, application deadlines, and other related questions. I trained the chatbot on common FAQs to make it responsive and interactive.

Model Training: With Watson Machine Learning and Watson Studio, I built and trained models to improve the chatbotâ€™s accuracy in understanding and responding to specific admission-related queries. This training ensures the bot can handle varied questions and provide accurate information.

Data Storage and Management: IBM Cloud Object Storage was utilized to store essential data and documentation for the project, including logs of user interactions. This data helps in refining and updating the chatbot periodically.

Deployment: I deployed the chatbot through the following link, making it accessible for user interactions:
